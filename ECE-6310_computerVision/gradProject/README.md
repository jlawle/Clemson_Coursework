# Semester Graduate Project - GUI active contouring
This lab's structure is based off of Lab 4's region interaction visual studio project solution. The main files used in the submission are shown in the submission folder.

### Implementation
This program allows a user to:
- left click + drag around a food item to shrink a contour to the food item
- right click to create a bubble that will expand to a given food's contour ( great for images with a lot of background noise)
- shift + left click a given contour point (after intial contouring) to adjust the point and recontour the food item again
