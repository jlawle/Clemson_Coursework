# Coding Kitchen of Tools
These are reference programs I found useful when working with programming various types of programs. Majority of this code is code provided by professors at Clemson, namely Dr. Bill Reid and Dr. Mark Smotherman from the classes systems programming (ECE 2220) and operating systems (ECE 3220), respectively. These files are provided and owned by Clemson University and they are not of my own creation.
